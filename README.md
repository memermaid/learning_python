- Tic Tac Toe game
Two people play Tic Tac Toe
One player is X and the other player is O.
Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, they win.
When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw.
